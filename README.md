RPN - Reverse Polish Notation

A simple Haskell program for converting algebraic expressions to the corresponding RPN forms.

I fell in love with Haskell. It might be because it's so different. There is no program flow; there are neither classic loops, nor classic variables; it's totally lazy and due to the laziness - efficient?! Sounds crazy and so seductive! (in my case - irresistibly seductive :)) The presented example is just another illustration of its power and potential, among many similar examples on internet.

This piece of code can be surely  improved; it's far from being perfect. However, I was playing with this problem, about a year ago, trying both C++ and Python, and I experienced much more difficulties. I can safely say that I payed considerably more efforts, at that time. Finally, there were more lines of less readable and more indistinct code. As for me, in regards to vague algorithms and complex decision making problems - it turns out that 'thinking functionally' is more suitable and certainly more effective than 'thinking procedurally' or 'thinking object oriented'. I've got a clear winner, here! So, in my opinion, functionall programming has a future, and Haskell as its pure representive, deserves respect. It should be loved - it's likely to be mutual!

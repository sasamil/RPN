RPN - Reverse Polish Notation

A simple Haskell program for converting algebraic expressions to the corresponding RPN forms.

I love Haskell and it's maybe due to the fact that it is so different. There is no program flow; there is neither classic loops, nor classic variables?! Sounds crazy and so seductive! Simply irresistible! This example is just another illustration of its power and potential.

I was playing with this problem (about a year ago) in C++ and Python. I can safely say that it was more difficult and I spent considerably more time on it. Simply, there were much more lines of less readable and more indistinct code. As for me, in regards to vague algorithms and complex decision making problems - it turns out that 'thinking functionally' is a clear winner! It is more suitable and certainly more efficient than 'thinking procedurally' (regardless of whether the second option is Object Oriented or not). In my opinion, functionall programming has a future and Haskell, as its pure representive, deserves respect. It should be loved!

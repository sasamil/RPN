RPN - Reverse Polish Notation

A simple program for converting algebraic expressions into the corresponding RPN forms. Yet another illustration of Haskell's power and potential, among many similar examples on internet.

I fell in love with Haskell. It might be because it's so different. It's totally lazy and due to the laziness - efficient! There is no program flow; there are neither classic loops, nor classic variables!? But, there are weird things like infinite lists, aplicative functors, recursive type structures, mutual recursions, monoids, monads... Sounds crazy. <img src="http://forum.srpskinacionalisti.com/images/smilies/eusa_shifty.gif" alt="crazy" height="15" width="15"> Looks so seductive! ( <i>as for me - irresistibly seductive</i> <!--img src="http://www.animated-gifs.eu/category_emoticons/smilies-love/0022.gif" alt="mutual love" height="25" width="37"--> ) 

This piece of code can be surely  improved; it's far from being perfect. However, I was playing with this problem, about a year ago, trying both C++ and Python, and then I experienced much more difficulties. I can safely say that I payed considerably more efforts, at that time. Finally, there were more lines of less readable and more indistinct code. As for me, in regards to vague algorithms and complex decision making problems - <i>thinking functionally</i> is more suitable and certainly more effective than <i>thinking procedurally</i> or <i>thinking object oriented</i>. I've got a clear winner, here! In my opinion, functionall programming has a future, and Haskell as its pure representive, deserves respect. It should be loved - it's likely to be mutual!

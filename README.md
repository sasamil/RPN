RPN - Reverse Polish Notation

A simple Haskell program for converting algebraic expressions to the corresponding RPN forms.

I love Haskell and it's maybe due to the fact that it is so different. This example is just an illustration of its power and potential.

When I was doing this, long before, in C++ and Python, it was much more difficult and I spent considerably more time. Simply, there were much more lines of less readable and more indistinct code. As for me, in regards to complex algorithmic and decision making problems - it turns out that 'thinking functionally' is a clear winner! It is more suitable and much more efficient than 'thinking procedurally' (regardless of whether the second option is Object Oriented or not). In my opinion, functionall programming has a future and its purest representive Haskell, deserves respect. It should be loved!

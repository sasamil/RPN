RPN - Reverse Polish Notation

A simple Haskell program for converting algebraic expressions to the corresponding RPN forms.

I love Haskell. It might be because it's so different. There is no program flow; there are neither classic loops, nor classic variables; it is totally lazy and due to the laziness - efficient?! Sounds crazy and so seductive! (in my case - irresistible :) ) This example is just another illustration of its power and potential.

This piece of code can be surely  improved; it's far from being perfect. However, I was playing with this problem (about a year ago) trying both C++ and Python, and I can safely say that it was much more difficult. Finally, I spent considerably more time on it. Simply, there were more lines of less readable and more indistinct code. As for me, in regards to vague algorithms and complex decision making problems - it turns out that 'thinking functionally' is more suitable and certainly more effective than 'thinking procedurally' or 'thinking object oriented'. We have a clear winner, here! So, imo, functionall programming has a future and Haskell, as its pure representive, deserves respect. It should be loved!

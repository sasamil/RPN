RPN - Reverse Polish Notation

A simple Haskell program for converting algebraic expressions to the corresponding RPN forms.

I love Haskell and it's maybe due to the fact that it's so different. There is no program flow; there is neither classic loops, nor classic variables?! Sounds crazy and so seductive! (In my case - irresistible :) ) This example is just another illustration of its power and potential.

This piece of code is far from being perfect and can be surely  improved. However, I was playing with this problem (about a year ago) in C++ and Python and I can safely say that it was more difficult. After all, I spent considerably more time on it. Simply, there were much more lines of less readable and more indistinct code. As for me, in regards to vague algorithms and complex decision making problems - it turns out that 'thinking functionally' is a clear winner! It is more suitable and certainly more efficient than 'thinking procedurally' or 'thinking object oriented'. In my opinion, functionall programming has a future and Haskell, as its pure representive, deserves respect. It should be loved!
